# Development
## Week 1
* Researched different ideas to work on for the final project
	* Looked at prior examples for final projects to get a general grasp at what students have done in the past
	* Narrowed down to 3 different ideas
		* Legend of Zelda Dungeon:
			* Pros: Very fun to do and something I enjoy, very similar to adventure mp
			* Cons: Very time consuming and may be out of scope for what I can accomplish
		* Rapper Soundboard:
			* Pros: Something I have been interested in for a while, can incorporate different elements of sound and visuals
			* Cons: Might not incorporate desired libraries to meet requirements, may not be challenging
		* Matrix Multiplier:
			* Pros: Can incorporate different topics I have learned in the past year from MATH415 and CS357
			* Cons: May be too simple
	* Picked the Rapper Soundboard due to the customablility
* Researched the different libraries needed to be incorporated
	* Found that ofSoundPlayer is a library that can be used to meet the requirement (said by Professor on Piazza)
		* Tested ofSoundPlayer in a seperate openFrameworks application
			* Played Star Wars Theme
			* Very simple to work with, found a guide online to see how to use ofSoundPlayer to play an MP3
	* Looked at ofxGui to add as a window for the application
	* Looked at ofxFft as a music visualizer for the project
* Wrote Proposal for the project
