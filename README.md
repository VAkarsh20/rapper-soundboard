# Final Project: Rapper Adlib Soundboard
## Description
Welcome to my final project, a Rapper Adlib Soundboard. 
The application gives you the oppurunity to go through 4 different adlib groupings and use the keyboard to play their sounds.
The application is built into 5 different pages: Main Page, Travis Scott Page, Migos, Lil Rappers Page, and Producers Page.
Moreover, there are directions on the screen to show which keys the user can press to either play/stop sounds and naviagte through the pages.
