# Project Proposal
## Project Title
Rapper Soundboard
## Overview
For my project I want to create a Rapper Adlib soundboard. The application will give the user the ability to chose between 5 differtent rappers and play with their most famous "adlibs".
From Travis Scott's "It's Lit" to Lil Wayne's "Young Money," adlibs have been dominating the current hip-hop scene in the recent years as its purpose is to add depth to an existing track.
For the design of the app, there will be an opening tab for the user to pick the Rapper pack they want to work with and a help tab to show how to manuever through the app.
In each of the Rapper tabs, the user will be shown the different adlibs available to work with and the user will have the option to play multiple adlibs at once and stop all sound with one button.
I wanted to create this application because it allows the user to listen to and hear some of the best yet funniest parts of songs.
Moreover, the soundboard give me experience making these types of applications as I am interested in creating soundboards for different types of entertainment.

## Further Implementation
If I am satisfied with how I finished my project, as I alluded to earlier, I can use the same general framework to make soundboards for different types of entertainment.
The power with this idea is that it is very universal in its actual structure. 
The sounds and images can be switched out for different themes, so I can end up making a new soundboard based on a different topic while keeping the same structure.
