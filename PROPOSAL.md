# Project Proposal
## Project Title
Rapper Soundboard
## Overview
For my project I want to create a Rapper Adlib soundboard. The application will give the user the ability to chose between 5 differtent rappers and play with their most famous "adlibs".
From Travis Scott's "It's Lit" to Lil Wayne's "Young Money," adlibs have been dominating the current hip-hop scene in the recent years as its purpose is to add depth to an existing track.
For the design of the app, there will be an opening tab for the user to pick the Rapper pack they want to work with and a help function to show to manuever through the app.
In each of the Rapper tabs, the user will be shown the different adlibs available to work and the user will have the option to play multiple adlibs at once and stop all sound with one button.
I wanted to create this application because it allows the user to listen to and hear some of the best yet funniest parts of songs.
Moreover, the soundboard give me experience making these types of applications as I am interested in creating soundboards for different types of entertainment.
